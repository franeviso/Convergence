\begin_layout Abstract

\size small
Mutualistic networks show high levels of convergence, complementarity and
 nestedness.
 Convergence and complementarity have been attributed to coevolutionary
 interaction selection under a phenotype matching scenario.
 It is not clear, however, whether phenotype matching fits empirical patterns
 better than a phenotype difference scenario.
 Here, we present a spatially and genetically explicit plant-animal trait
 diversification model 
\change_deleted -303280620 1473147116
under the phenotype difference scenario
\change_inserted -303280620 1473404139

\size default
 which uses a new model that lies between the phenotype matching and phenotype
 difference model
\change_unchanged

\size small
.
 Our model predicts high levels of convergence, complementarity, and nestedness.
 Comparing the model predictions with observed levels of complementarity
 and convergence
\change_deleted -303280620 1473147116
 
\change_unchanged
 in an empirical plant-hummingbird mutualistic network, we find that, unlike
 previous models, they match well, except for convergence patterns in plants.
 Our results indicate that combining the spatial structure of plant-animal
 trait diversification with population dynamics in a phenotypic difference
 model alter predictions in a direction that is more in line with observations,
 and hence are important to be included in future studies of evolutionary
 patterns in mutualistic networks.

 how species interactions generate trait changes.
 The first clear indication of coevolution was Darwin's moth example

Theoretical studies suggest that evolutionary convergence and complementarity

\begin_inset Quotes eld

phenotype matching model
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (Nuismer et al.
 2005; Kopp and Gavrilets 2006).
 For example, in highly specialized two-species interactions such as the
 fig-fig wasp mutualism 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Bronstein-2006"

\end_inset

, plants coevolve with their most efficient pollinator to strengthen the
 complementarity of their matching traits.
 The phenotype matching model assumes that the probability of a successful
 interaction decreases with increasing distance between the phenotypes of
 the interacting individuals (Nuismer et al, 2012).
 Examples are plant and animal phenology (Jordano et al.
 2003; Olesen et al.
 2010; Encinas-Viso et al, 2012) or proboscis and corolla lengths (Agosta
 and Janzen 2005; Santamaría and Rodríguez-Gironés 2007; Stang et al.

 explored the importance of coevolutionary selection in a multispecifies
 context to study the emergence of convergence, complementarity and network
 structure in mutualistic networks.
 They found that weak coevolutionary selection produces little to no convergence
 but generates high complementary.
 As coevolutionary selection intensifies, variation in the trait values
 of animal and plant species is reduced and high convergence emerges but
 complementarity decreases.
 Furthermore they found antinested networks regardless of the strength of
 coevolutionary selection.

 to which the animal trait exceeds the plant trait as might be the case

 What are the results for complementarity and convergence under the phenotype

 Furthermore, similar to the phenotypic matching model, convergence increases
 with the strength of coevolution in the phenotypic difference model (but
 only when interactions depend strongly of phenotypes); however complementarity
 is weaker for interactions mediated by phenotype difference than those
 mediated by phenotype matchings
\change_unchanged
.
 Taken together, these results suggest that it is not trivial to simultaneously
 explain high degrees of convergence, complementarity and nestedness in
 species-rich mutualistic networks as observed in empirical data (

 Our model lies between a phenotype matching and phenotype difference model,
 as an interaction can only occur when the animal trait exceeds the plant
 trait, but the probability of success does not increase with this difference.
 Furthermore, we use a definition of convergence that accounts for phylogenetic
 relatedness.

 Comparing these predictions to convergence and complementarity patterns

Eco-evolutionary trait diversification in mutualistic networks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To study the effect of spatial structure and plant-animal trait diversification
 on convergence, complementarity and nestedness in mutualistic networks,
 we develop a spatial quantitative genetics model for plant-animal interactions
 with overlapping generations.
 Individuals have fixed genome size and we start with one plant and animal
 species with all individuals having the same genetic composition at the
 outset (see Figure 1 for the steps of the model).
 Following population demography males and females individuals in both communiti
es must be close enough in spatial, genetic, and morphological space for
 an obligate mutualistic interactions to occur (Figure 1 step B) and to
 produce offpsring with a new genotype-phenotype after mutation, recombination
 and phenotypic plasticity (Figure 1 step C, D and E).
 We follow the species definition of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Nei1983"

\end_inset

, where a species is a group of interbreeding and successfully reproducing
 individuals that are reproductively isolated from other groups.
 In our model two individuals can mate successfully if their genetic similarity
 value is larger than or equal to the minimum genetic similarity value.
 Thus, speciation is defined as a group of genetically related individuals,
 where two individuals in a sexual population can be
\change_deleted -303280620 1472708583
 
\change_unchanged
 incompatible, but still conspecific as long as they can exchange genes
 indirectly through other conspecifics

A focal species is considered to have convergent traits with another species
 if it is phenotypically more similar to this other species than to the
 genetically most similar species (the sister species) (see figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Evolutionary-convergence"

\end_inset

 and SI).
 The number of convergences potentially increases with the number of species
 present.
 For example, if we have ten species and we exclude one of them as the sister
 species of the focal species, we have nine species to calculate convergence.
 If we find that two out of nine species are phenotypically similar enough
 to the focal species, we count two (out of nine,
\begin_inset Formula $\sim22\%$
\end_inset

) convergences.
 We repeat this by changing the focal species and calculate the mean number
 of convergence events over all species.
 In contrast to previous approaches that used the mean pair-wise difference
 between traits of species 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 or the variance of species traits in a guild as a proxy to predict convergence
 (i.e., large values weak convergence whereas small values of the variance
 may indicate strong convergence, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 of development of very similar trait values in sister species due to shared
 evolutionary history

 Why construct the phylogenies from GenBank sequences and then simulate
 new sequences on this phylogeny? It would be best to simply use the GenBank
 sequences to construct the similarity matrices, but we don't have overlapping
 sequences for all pairs of species, so we need to work via the tree, but
 then it is best to use the tree itself to determine genetic distance.

 You take the distance between any pair of species from the tree as the

Convergence and complementarity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Evolutionary convergence events occurred in all replicate simulations (see
 equations SI-4 and SI-5 with an example of evolutionary convergence events
 in animals and plants represented in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:convergence-complementarity"

\end_inset

).
 Convergence events were heterogeneously distributed across species with
 most events occurring between common species (0.42 < Spearman-
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 < 0.89, all 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 < 0.05).
 Evolutionary convergence occurred on average in 
\begin_inset Formula $17.3\pm6\%$
\end_inset

 of all possible convergence events with more than 95% of these events involving
 some of the three most common species.
 These results show that evolutionary convergence is not randomly distributed
 across pairs of species but highly aggregated during the diversification
 process.
 Evolutionary convergence can also be visualized using a scatter plot of
 the genotype-phenotype map for all pairs of individuals within the plant
 and animal communities (see Figure SI-1 Supplementary Information).
 As expected from equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:genetic_comp"

\end_inset

, there is a positive genotype-phenotype relationship.
 The scatter plot contains three main clouds of points that consistently
 occur in our simulations for the plants,

: 1) pairs of individuals of the same species with high genetic (
\begin_inset Formula $q_{ij}>q_{min}$
\end_inset

) and phenotypic (
\begin_inset Formula $p_{ij}>0.9$
\end_inset

) similarity, 2) pairs of individuals of the same species with genetic similarit
y below 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{min}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $q_{ij}<q_{min}=0.97$
\end_inset

) and high phenotypic similarity (
\begin_inset Formula $p_{ij}>0.9$
\end_inset

).
 These are incompatible individuals of the same species for mating, yet
 with high phenotypic similarity, 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{ij}>0.9$
\end_inset

, and 3) highly genetically dissimilar individuals from different species,
 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{ij}\ll q_{min}$
\end_inset

, but with the presence of highly phenotypically similar individuals (
\begin_inset Formula $p_{ij}>0.9$
\end_inset

).
 This last category shows evidence of evolutionary convergence between species
 in plants and animals.
 An increase in mutation rate increases the genetic divergence between species,
 as expected, but it does not change the genotype-phenotype relationship
 qualitatively (see Figure SI-1 Supplementary Information).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Evolutionary complementarity occurred with a similar frequency as evolutionary
 convergence in each replicate (see equation SI-5 and compare the initial
 with the final trait distributions in figure

\end_inset

), but with a larger variation (
\begin_inset Formula $20\pm18\%$
\end_inset

 Connectance values were consistently medium or high (
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{C}=0.5\pm0.07$

 0.05 and

 Nestedness values were always high (

\end_inset

 (figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

)), as observed in the empirical plant-pollinator networks.
 Convergence, complementarity and nestedness did not show signs of trade-offs
 and were uncorrelated across all replicates (0.08 < Spearman-
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 < 0.27, all 
\begin_inset space ~

\begin_inset Formula $p$

\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 Our results, using phylogenetic relatedness and phenotypic similarity for
 the estimation of evolutionary convergence and complementarity under weak
 coevolutionary selection, show evolutionary trait convergence and complementari
ty in all our replicate simulations but with little and large variation,
 respectively.
 These results suggest that in our model, trait convergence in plant and
 animal communities is largely independent or positively correlated with
 trait complementarity for the animal and plant community, respectively.

\begin_layout Subsection*
Comparison of model predictions with empirical data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our model predicts well plant-animal complementarity and convergence for
 animals but not for plants in a empirical plant-hummingbird mutualistic
 network (Figure 6).
 The observed proportion of complementarity events for the empirical plant-hummi
ngbird data is within the CI for a broad range of values of the complementarity
 threshold, 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{comp}$
\end_inset

 (Figure 6a).
 Our model consistently predicts higher proportion of convergence events
 than the observed proportion in the plant community (Figure 6b).
 Predictions in the proportion of convergence events quickly increase for
 a high convergence threshold value both in the empirical data and in our
 model predictions (red lines Figure 6b) and saturates around the same observed
 values for medium and low convergent threshold values.
 Predictions of the proportion of convergence events for the hummingbird
 community are within the estimated CI for all the range of convergence
 threshold values (Figure 6c).
 These results show that predictions for plant-animal complementarity and
 convergence in the hummingbird community are robust against a broad range
 of threshold values.

 I really think that our model is performing better because it does not

 This is a model between the phenotype matching and phenotype difference

 has shown that for weak coevolutionary selection trait values in animal
 and plant species can be highly variable and non-convergent, but trait
 values of animal and plants species show high complementarity (i.e.
 they are positively correlated)
\change_deleted 696368358 1466607828
 
\change_unchanged
.
 However, strong coevolutionary selection decreases variation in the trait
 values of animal and plant species increasing convergence and simultaneously
 complementarity decreases (i.e.
 correlations between traits of interacting species are weakened).
 Interestingly, the results of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 for a complementarity trait between the plants and animals.

 (i.e.
 evolution driven by other forces not related to mutualistic interactions

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 However, our model shows that by considering a more realistic model of
 phenotype differences in a more realistic setting gives results that are
 more like the observations than the results of previous models.
 In other words, it is possible to observe the evolution of both convergence
 and complementarity.
 It remains to be seen whether the action of both (selective an non-selective
 forces) and other models of plant-animal interaction (e.g.
 'phenotypic matching') will be able to generate the observed patterns of
 high convergence, complementarity and nestedness in species-rich mutualistic
 networks.

Non-selective forces underlying trait dynamics can produce convergence.
 For example,

 simulated evolution along phylogenies according to a Brownian motion model
 of trait change and demonstrated that rates of convergence can be quite

 Furthermore, other type
\change_inserted 696368358 1466679103

 of constraints in the production of variation can also lead to convergence.
 If the variation produced is limited, then unrelated species are likely
 to produce the same variation, which may then become fixed in the population
 by genetic drift 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Developmental constraints or the evolution of genetic networks by non-adaptive
 processes may also be explanations for the convergence of traits 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Sole_convergence_selection_networks,Lynch:2007,Losos_2011"

\end_inset

, but the role of developmental constraints or genetic networks in determining
 convergence in species-rich mutualistic networks has yet not been explored.
 For example, the tinkering of traits by evolutionary forces largely affects
 developmental pathways (e.g.
 gene regulatory networks) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Developmental pathways are not static but can diverge through time randomly
 without substantially affecting the phenotype

 This concept, also called developmental system drift (DSD) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

 traits and it should be considered as another process where drift can act
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Ohta_2002"

\end_inset

, for example, by random wiring in gene regulatory networks.
 Our results based on a method that excludes cases of the development of
 a similar trait in related but distinct species descending from the same
 ancestor show that additional constraints such as dispersal limitation
 and assortative mating limit the production of variation and lead consistently
 to convergence in distinct lineages in species-rich mutualistic networks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Evolutionary complementarity is also consistently observed in our results
 but with a larger variation than convergence.
 Complementarity is argued to be the main result of tight coevolution between

.
 In contrast, our results show that medium levels of complementarity can
 emerge from relatively non-selective forces and constraints occurring at
 several levels, from geographic limits to encounter partners and disperse
 to the genetic and morphological constraints on producing viable offspring.
 In addition, our model fitting show our predictions fit well to the observed
 plant-hummingbird complementarity across a broad range of complementarity
 threshold values (Figure 6).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our predictions are able to reproduce some observed patterns of convergence
 and complementarity in a plant-hummingbird community.
 Observed convergence values were close to those predicted by the model
 for the hummingbird community, but we predicted more convergence values
 than those observed in the plant community.
 According to previous models, fewer convergence events could be indicative
 of weak coevolutionary selection processes acting on the plant species.
 Although this is a possible explanation for our overestimation of convergence,
 we think that our convergence estimates may have been biased by the fact
 that we could not consider all the plant species of the community (
\begin_inset Formula $\approx$
\end_inset

 50%) only around 60% of the hummingbird species.
 Our study is the first to quantify and compare convergence and complementarity
 values from an empirical dataset with model predictions and we believe
 this a major leap towards the understanding of multispecific coevolution
 and community assembly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
The problem of calculating convergence
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One prominent problem in the literature is how to quantify convergence.
 This problem is probably related to the lack of a rigorous or precise definitio
n of convergence (REFS).
 Previous studies (Nuismer et al, Guimaraes et al) proposed different ways
 of doing this, but their
\change_deleted -303280620 1476424405
 
\change_unchanged
 measurements of convergence do not consider phylogenetic relatedness.
 For example, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "guimaraes_coevol_2011"

\end_inset

 measured convergence as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the mean pair-wise difference between traits of species at same trophic
 level
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 considering all the species of the guild.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Nuismeretal2012"

\end_inset

 calculated the variance as a proxy to predict convergence (i.e., large values
 weak convergence whereas small values of the variance may indicate strong
 convergence).
 The main problem with these measurements that ignore phylogenetic relatedness
 is that they will tend to overestimate convergence events
\change_deleted -303280620 1476424414
 
\change_unchanged
 .
 Most definitions of convergence agree that it is an evolutionary pattern
 in which 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

similar phenotypes evolve 
\emph on
independently
\emph default
 in multiple lineages
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (Stayton, 2015).
 Therefore, it is important to consider phylogenetic distance to correct
 for shared and therefore dependent evolutionary history.
 Our model with our new measure of convergence, which considers phylogenetic
 relatedness and phenotypic similarity, shows that in the absence of abiotic
 selection trait convergence and complementarity always evolve but with
 little and large variation, respectively.
 Therefore, even with a more conservative estimate of the number of convergence
 events, the results show that the modelled
\change_deleted -303280620 1476424446
 
\change_unchanged
 processes (or background evolution sensu 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 patterns in mutualistic networks.
 They show that coevolutionary selection tend to decrease nestedness and
 it generates even more strongly antinested networks when coevolutionary
 selection increases by favoring the emergence of reciprocal specialization.
 In contrast, nestedness values were very high in our model, as in real

 and species abundance distribution ('neutral forbidden links'

), are determinants of the structure of mutualistic networks.
 Connectance values obtained from our simulations are close to the predictions
 of other neutral network models 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 However, compared to real mutualistic networks with similar diversity as
 ours (24 plant and animal species on average), our connectance values (
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{C}=0.5$
\end_inset

) are higher than the reported webs (
\begin_inset Formula $C=0.28$
\end_inset

) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 Interestingly, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

\end_inset

 found that only assuming coevolutionary selection forces also leads to
 an increase in connectance.
 This means that both basic genetic and ecological processes and coevolutionary
 selection can increase connectance in mutualistic networks.
 The question is why observed mutualistic webs have a lower connectance
 than those predicted by our model and previous models.
 We conjecture that this difference in connectance values might be due to
 different types of forbidden links (i.e.
 biological constraints impeding plant-animal interactions), such as phenology

 or environmental fluctuations that were not explicitly included in our
 approach.

\begin_layout Standard
In summary, our results show the emergence of convergence, complementarity
 and nestedness following basic genetic and ecological processes.
 Our predictions fit well to the observed plant-hummingbird complementarity
 and hummingbird convergence.
 In contrast to previous studies showing antinested networks, we found highly
 nested values in agreement with empirical mutualistic networks 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 Our results suggest that diversification dynamics combining ecological
 (demography and dispersal limitation), population genetics (mutation, recombina
tion, assortative mating and drift) and morphological constraints may form
 the basic processes producing the key patterns of mutualistic networks,
 from trait convergence and complementarity to connectance and nestedness.

The model: evo-evolutionary trait diversification in mutualistic networks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To study the role of spatial structure and plant-animal trait diversification
 on convergence, complementarity and nestedness, we start by considering
 a landscape consisting of several individual plants (
\emph on
P
\emph default
) and animal pollinators (
\emph on
A
\emph default
).
 We model obligate mutualism for both partners and the number of individuals
 at each trophic level is fixed and equal to the environmental carrying
 capacity for the given community.
 Genetic, phenotypic and species composition change in time and space due
 to population dynamics.
 At each time step replacement of dead individuals are followed by the offspring
 of the same or another species (the key terms and model steps are summarized
 in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 and table 1, respectively).
 In this section we explain how we model populations, traits, and diversificatio
n.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*

Population dynamics 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our model is a stochastic individual-based model with overlapping generations.
 The population consists of 
\begin_inset Formula $J_{P}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $J_{A}$
\end_inset

 haploid gonochoric (i.e.
 separated sexes) individuals with an explicit genome of size 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 each and equal sex ratios at the outset.
 The genome of each individual is composed of 
\begin_inset Formula $L-1$
\end_inset

 loci determining assortative mating and one neutral locus.
 Both plant and animal population reproduce sexually and are spatially structure
d.
 First an individual plant 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 and an animal 
\begin_inset Formula $k'$
\end_inset

 are randomly removed (death).
 They are replaced by reproduction.
 There are four conditions for producing viable offspring for the plants
 and animals.
 These four conditions are 1) geography, 2) genetics, 3) obligate mutualism
 and 4) morphology: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Geography: a female and a male individual within the plant and animal population
s are randomly chosen among all females and males within a maximum distance,
 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{max}$
\end_inset

 , of the dead plant 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 and dead animal 
\begin_inset Formula $k'$
\end_inset

.
 This requires two geographic distance matrices, one for plants, 
\begin_inset Formula $D^{P}$
\end_inset

 = [
\begin_inset Formula $d_{ij}^{P}$
\end_inset

], and one for animals, 
\begin_inset Formula $D^{A}$
\end_inset

 = [
\begin_inset Formula $d_{ij}^{A}$
\end_inset

], containing all the pairwise distances.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Genetics: to produce viable offspring the female and the male in the plant
 and animal populations must have a genetic similarity value of the assortative
 mating loci, 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{\venus\mars}$
\end_inset

, higher than the minimum genetic similarity to have viable offspring, 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{min}$
\end_inset

, (
\begin_inset Formula $q_{\venus\mars}>q_{min}$
\end_inset

).
 This process reflects assortative mating and it requires two genetic similarity
 matrices, one for plants, 
\begin_inset Formula $Q^{P}$
\end_inset

 = [
\begin_inset Formula $q_{ij}^{P}$
\end_inset

], and one for animals, 
\begin_inset Formula $Q^{A}$
\end_inset

 = [
\begin_inset Formula $q_{ij}^{A}$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Obligate mutualism: in order to have a mutualistic interaction the geographic
 distance between the female, 
\begin_inset Formula $\venus$
\end_inset

 (animal or plant), and one of the two male animal or plant individuals,
 represented here as 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

, must be lower than the maximum distance, 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{max}^{PA}$
\end_inset

, (
\begin_inset Formula $d_{j\venus}^{PA}<d_{max}^{PA}$
\end_inset

).
 This requires one geographic plant-animal distance matrix, 
\begin_inset Formula $D^{PA}$
\end_inset

 = [
\begin_inset Formula $d_{ij}^{PA}$
\end_inset

], containing all the pairwise distances.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Morphology: the female plant need the presence of an animal pollinator with
 a larger or equally-sized proboscis than the corolla of the plant, thus
 the phenotype of the selected pollinator, represented here as 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

, must satisfy 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{\venus}^{P}\leq z_{j}^{A}$
\end_inset

.
 This requires two phenotype distributions, one for the plants, 
\begin_inset Formula $Z^{P}=[z_{i}^{P}]$
\end_inset

 and one for the animals, 
\begin_inset Formula $Z^{A}=[z_{i}^{A}]$
\end_inset

Diversification dynamics

\begin_layout Standard
To quantify speciation events we calculate the genetic distance between
 each pair of individuals based on the assortative mating loci.
 We represent the genome of each individual by a sequence of 
\begin_inset Formula $L-1$
\end_inset

 loci, where each locus can be in two allelic states, 
\begin_inset Formula $+1$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $-1$
\end_inset

.
 The assortative mating loci of each plant individual 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 in a population of size 
\begin_inset Formula $J_{P}$
\end_inset

 is represented as a vector: 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{i}=(S_{1}^{i},S_{2}^{i},...,S_{L}^{i})$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{u}^{i}$
\end_inset

 is the 
\begin_inset Formula $u^{th}$
\end_inset

 locus of individual 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

.
 The genetic similarity based on assortatove mating loci between individuals
 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 is calculated as the sum of identical loci across the genome
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
q_{ij}^{P}=\frac{1}{L}\sum_{u=1}^{L}S_{u}^{i}S_{u}^{j}\label{eq:genetic_similarity-1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{ij}^{P}\in\{-1,1\}$
\end_inset

 with the genetic similarity matrix, 
\begin_inset Formula $Q^{P}$
\end_inset

 = [
\begin_inset Formula $q_{ij}^{P}$
\end_inset

], containing all pairwise genetic similarity values for plants (the same
 for animals, 
\begin_inset Formula $Q^{A}$
\end_inset

 = [
\begin_inset Formula $q_{ij}^{A}$
\end_inset

]).
 The genome of the offspring is obtained by a block cross-over recombination
 of a female genome, 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{\venus}$
\end_inset

, and a male genome, 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{\mars}$
\end_inset

, where a locus 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

 in the genome of the parents is randomly chosen partitioning the genome
 of each individual in two blocks.
 All genes beyond that locus 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

 in either genome are swapped between the two parents and eventually form
 two new genomes.
 One of the two new genomes is randomly chosen for the offspring.
 The offspring's genome undergoes mutations at mutation rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 describes the recombination-mutation process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the beginning of the simulations all individuals are genetically identical
 (all 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{ij}^{P}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{ij}^{A}$
\end_inset

 = 1); hence they are all able to mate and produce viable offspring regardless
 of their spatial location.
 The genetic similarity between individuals of a guild can be visualized
 as an evolutionary spatial graph 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "melian2010_plos"

\end_inset

, where nodes correspond to individuals and the edges correspond to the
 geographic distances between a pair of individuals satisfying the genetic
 similarity condition for mating, 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{ij}^{P}(q_{ij}^{A})>q_{min}$
\end_inset

.
 The connectance of the graph will decrease when generations move forward
 because of the processes described in the previous section: 1) spatial
 constraints for mating driving assortative mating and dispersal limitation;
 2) genetic divergence driven by the threshold for mating (incompatibilities),
 mutation and recombination forming the genome of the offspring; 3) obligate
 mutualistic interactions driven by spatial proximity of individuals of
 the other guild, and 4) morphological constraints following the phenotype
 differences scenario.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These four set of processes drive genetic divergence and speciation.
 We followed the species definition of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Nei1983"

\end_inset

, which states that species are groups of individuals that are reproductively
 isolated and can interbreed to produce fertile offspring.
 In our model this is realized through allowing two individuals to mate
 successfully if their genetic similarity value is larger or equal to the
 minimum value, 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{min}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, speciation is defined as a group of genetically related individuals,
 where two individuals in a sexual population can be conspecific while also
 being incompatible, as long as they can exchange genes indirectly through
 other conspecifics 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "deaguiar_2009,melian2010_plos"

\end_inset

.
 This is the definition of 'ring species' 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "MoritzSchneider1992"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Genetic divergence will eventually produce the formation of two genetically
 incompatible clusters of individuals, i.e.
 two species.
 This speciation process, also called 'fission-induced' speciation, continues
 to form more clusters and genetic divergence between individuals of different
 species increases.
 However, the diversification dynamics will fluctuate due to random extinctions
 (death of last individual of a species).
 A stochastic balance between speciation and extinction is eventually reached
 giving the final steady-state of the metacommunity.

Quantitative trait dynamics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We model each individual plant and animal with a quantitative trait, 
\begin_inset Formula $z^{P}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $z^{A}$
\end_inset

, respectively.
 The processes described in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 govern two quantitative traits, one for each guild: proboscis or bill length
 (
\begin_inset Formula $z_{i}^{A}$
\end_inset

) in pollinators and corolla length (
\begin_inset Formula $z_{i}^{P})$
\end_inset

 in plants.
 The quantitative trait of offspring is determined by the additive genetic
 effects of the genome (i.e.
 no epistasis) after the process of randomly choosing one of the two new
 genomes and mutation (figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

) plus a normally distributed environmental effect, 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$

\end_inset

) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 The phenotype of the plant offspring 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{i}^{P}=g_{i}^{P}+\epsilon$
\end_inset

 and the genetic component (
\begin_inset Formula $g_{i}^{P}$
\end_inset

) of the phenotype of offspring 
\begin_inset Formula $i$

 is

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula

\end{equation}

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{o}^{i}=\sum_{u=1}^{L}S_{u}^{i}$
\end_inset

.
 Hence 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{i}^{P}$
\end_inset

 is calculated as the sum of alleles across the genome 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

 plus the number of loci to avoid negative trait values (
\begin_inset Formula $g_{i}^{A}$

 We assumed that the magnitude of the influence (i.e., effect sizes) of any
 given locus on this quantitative trait is equal across all the loci 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 This means that two individuals with a different combination of alleles

We considered a neutral locus to estimate genetic divergence among species

 The neutral locus is located at the end of the genome at the position 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 and it has 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 possible allelic states.
 The locus is completely unlinked from the rest of the genome that contains
 the assortative mating loci.
 We used low mutation rates for this neutral locus, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{neutral}=10^{-7}$
\end_inset

 , and the 
\begin_inset Formula $k$

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
p_{ij}^{P}=1-\frac{|z_{i}^{P}-z_{j}^{P}|}{z_{max}^{P}}\label{eq:phenotypic_sim-1}

where 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{i}^{P}$

Mean genetic and phenotypic species similarity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We define evolutionary convergence as the similarity between average species
 phenotypes from distantly related species.
 We assume that two species are distantly related, in phylogenetic terms,
 if they do not come from a direct common ancestor, i.e.
 they are not sister species.
 To exclude sister species from the analysis we need to calculate the mean
 genetic similarity among species of the same guild.
 The mean genetic similarity between a plant species 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 and a plant species 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

 is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\hat{q}_{kl}^{P}=\frac{1}{n_{k}n_{l}}\sum_{i=1}^{n_{k}}\sum_{j=i}^{n_{l}}q_{ij}^{P}\label{eq:genetic_sim_species-1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{ij}^{P}$
\end_inset

 is the genetic similarity between an individual 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 of plant species 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 and an individual 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 of plant species 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{k}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{l}$
\end_inset

 are the absolute abundances of plant species 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

, respectively.
 The elements 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{q}_{kl}^{P}$
\end_inset

 form the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{s}^{P}=[\hat{q}_{kl}^{P}]$
\end_inset

 from which the sister species of each species in the guild can be identified
 (The elements for animals, 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{s}^{A}=[\hat{q}_{kl}^{A}]$
\end_inset

, are calculated in the same way as we did for the plants).
 To calculate evolutionary convergence we need to know the average phenotypic
 similarity between two species.
 We define phenotypic similarity between species 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

 as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\hat{p}_{kl}^{P}=\frac{1}{n_{k}n_{l}}\sum_{i=1}^{n_{k}}\sum_{j=i}^{n_{l}}p_{ij}^{P}\label{eq:phenotypic_sim_species-1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

which is analogous to the definition of eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:genetic_sim_species-1"

\end_inset

, but now considering phenotypes instead of genotypes.
 This will build a species phenotypic similarity matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{s}^{P}=[\hat{p}_{kl}^{P}]$
\end_inset

 (the species phenotypic similarity matrix, 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{s}^{A}=[\hat{p}_{kl}^{A}]$
\end_inset

, is calculated analogously for the animals).
 We then focus on each species in turn and exclude its sister species to
 avoid cases of parallel evolution to calculate the number of convergences
 related to the focal species.
 We define a focal plant species 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 and a non-sister plant species 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

 to be convergent if phenotypic similarity between them is higher than between
 focal and sister species (
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{p}_{k,sister}^{P}<\hat{p}_{kl}^{P}$
\end_inset

) and higher than a certain phenotypic threshold value 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{conv}$

Plant-animal interactions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to the genetic and geographic constraints for mating, we consider
 two other conditions for plants and animals: obligate mutualism and morphologic
al constraints.
 Obligate mutualism applies to the plants and animals to reproduce but the
 morphological constraints only apply to plants.
 We therefore need a geographic distance matrix, 
\begin_inset Formula $D^{PA}$
\end_inset

, to describe the geographic distance between plant and animal individuals.
 Plant-animal mutualistic interactions are here described as follows: plants
 benefit from the presence of specific pollinators that are able to pollinate
 them and animals benefit from the presence of plants that provide resources
 for them.
 Thus, we have two extra conditions for mating: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Female plants need the presence of an animal pollinator (i.e., male and female
 represented as 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

) within a close distance, 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{j\venus}^{PA}<d_{max}^{PA}$
\end_inset

.
 The pollinator must have a larger or equally-sized proboscis than the corolla
 of a plant, 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{\venus}^{P}\leq z_{j}^{A}$
\end_inset

.
 This corresponds to a morphological constraint for individual interactions
 observed between plant and pollinator species

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The death-birth cycle per time step.
 Individuals are represented as filled circles and blue tones represent
 variation of phenotypes.
 (A) an individual 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is randomly selected to die and leaves an empty location in the landscape.
 (B) a female individual, 
\begin_inset Formula $\venus$
\end_inset

, is randomly selected among all females satisfying the condition 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{k\venus}<d_{max}$
\end_inset

.
 We then choose randomly a male, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mars$
\end_inset

, among all males satisfying 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{k\mars}<d_{max}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{\venus\male}>q_{min}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{min}$
\end_inset

, the minimum genetic similarity required for mating.
 In addition to these two constraints, two more are required to complete
 mating.
 For the condition of obligate mutualism, the geographic distance between
 the female (animal or plant), and an animal (or plant) individual 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

, must satisfy 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{j\venus}^{PA}<d_{max}^{PA}$
\end_inset

.
 Finally, female plants need the presence of an animal pollinator with a
 larger or equally-sized proboscis than the corolla of the female plant,
 thus individual pollinators represented as 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

, must satisfy 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{\venus_{P}}\leq z_{j_{A}}$
\end_inset

.
 In (C) and (D) we calculate the genome of the new offspring once these
 constraints are satisfied.
 (C) Genomes are composed of 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 loci where each locus can be in two allelic states (
\begin_inset Formula $-1,\,1$
\end_inset

) and undergo block crossover recombination between female (dark gray) and
 male (black).
 A position 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

 in the genome of the parents is randomly chosen partitioning the genome
 in two blocks.
 All genes beyond the 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

 locus in either organism's genome is swapped between two parents and two
 new genomes are formed.
 (D) One of the two new genomes is randomly chosen for the offspring 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{o}^{i}$
\end_inset

, and it might undergo mutation (light gray).
 (E) The phenotype expression of offspring 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{i}=g_{i}+\epsilon$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{i}=L+S_{o}^{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

 are the genetic and environmental component of the phenotype, respectively.
 (F) The offspring 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 occupies the site of the dead individual 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.

A simple example of evolutionary convergence using species 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

.
 The upper matrix (
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{S}=[\hat{q}_{kl}]$
\end_inset

) shows species 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 are genetically closely related, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{q}_{ac}=0.97$
\end_inset

, while genetically distant from species 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{q}_{ab}=0.85$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{q}_{cb}=0.89$
\end_inset

).
 A clear description of these genetic relationships can be represented with
 a cluster tree or dendrogram, as shown in the lower part of the figure.
 Thus, we establish that species 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 are sister species.
 The species phenotypic similarity matrix, 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{S}=[\hat{p}_{kh}]$
\end_inset

 shows that species 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 are phenotypically highly similar (
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{p}_{ab}=0.98$
\end_inset

Changes in trait distribution of plants (top, blue) and animals (bottom,
 red).
 Left and right panels show the initial and final trait distribution, respective
ly.
 The insets in the right panels show the mean trait and standard error for
 each species sorted from the most common to the most rare.
 Initial trait distributions changed towards higher variance, and in most
 replicates, towards bimodal distribution in both guilds.
 Shown is the outputs from one replicate with parameters values

Evolutionary convergence and complementarity in plant-pollinator networks.
 Trees at the left and right side show genetic similarities between animal
 (red) and plant (blue) species, respectively.
 Mean species trait, proboscis and corolla length, is sketched with cartoons
 next to their respective position in the trees.
 Animals, composed by six species, have two evolutionary convergence events
 (A-B and F-D).
 Plants, composed by three species, have one convergent event (b-c).
 The central part of the figure shows the network of plant-animal interactions,
 where each node (colored filled circles) represents an individual.
 The network is composed of two types of links: genetic relatedness links
 (black solid) forming clusters that represent species and plant-animal
 individual-based interaction links (gray).
 The network shows variability in terms of genetic relatedness and plant-animal
 interactions within a species (i.e.
 high intraspecific variability).
 This figure is an example from one simulation.
 Parameters used are as in figure 3,

Plant-animal species interaction network.
 Plant species are represented in rows and animal species in columns.
 The color gradient indicates the number of mutualistic partners (i.e.
 individuals interacting) shared between plant and animal species.
 This matrix comes from one replicate with nine plant and thirteen animal
 species.
 The network shows high level of nestedness (

Comparison of model's predictions with estimations of convergence and complement
arity from an empirical data of a plant-pollinator community.
 a) The proportion of complementarity events (y-axis) as a function of the
 complementarity threshold (x-axis) for the empirical data (dotted black
 line) and for the model (continuous and dotted red lines represent mean,
 0.05 and 0.95 CI values, respectively).
 Predictions are within the CI for most complementarity threshold values.
 Empirical data deviates from model predictions for complementarity threshold
 values around 0.4 and lower.
 b) The proportion of convergence events in the plant community (y-axis,
 69 species) as a function of the convergence threshold (x-axis) for the
 empirical data (dotted black line) and for the model (continuous and dotted
 red lines represent mean, 0.05 and 0.95 CI values, respectively).
 Convergence events in the empirical data strongly deviates from model predictio
ns for convergence threshold values ranging between 1 and approx.
 0.82.
 In that range, model predicts much higher proportion of convergence events
 than the empirical observations.
 c) The proportion of convergence events in the animal community (y-axis,
 24 species) as a function of the convergence threshold (x-axis) for the
 empirical data (dotted black line) and for the model (continuous and dotted
 red lines represent mean, 0.05 and 0.95 CI values, respectively).
 Convergence events in the empirical data are within the CI of model predictions
 for most convergence threshold values.
