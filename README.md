# Convergence

This project studies the evolution of convergence and complementarity of interaction traits in plant-animal mutualistic networks.
The model is a spatially and genetically explicit individual-based model considering selection, migration and drift. The demography of the model is stochastic based on a Moran model (death-birth model). The model has been initially developed in Python 2.7 by Francisco Encinas. There are new extensions of the model done by Hanno Hildenbrandt.
