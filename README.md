# Convergence

This project studies the evolution of convergence and complementarity of traits in plant-animal mutualistic networks.
The model is a spatially and genetically explicit individual-based model considering selection and drift. The demography of the model is stochastic based on a Moran model (death-birth model). 
The model has been developed in Python 2.7.
