Hi Carlos,

The simplest way I see is to take the convergence/complementarity vs
threshold plots. This removes the differences in tree sizes, does it
not? Then we can do least squares model fitting, where we sum over the
squared differences with each empirical tree (integrated over the
threshold value from 0 to 1), i.e. the sum of 'squared' areas between
the curves.
More sophisticated is to use ABC, but again we need to have a measure of
distance to the empirical tree, and again we need something like the sum
of 'squared' areas between the curves.

Cheers,

Rampal

Now we are going to have several empirical trees and several different size trees from the model. Any advise on how to combine these two kind of trees to produce the threshold --- %convergence plot?
