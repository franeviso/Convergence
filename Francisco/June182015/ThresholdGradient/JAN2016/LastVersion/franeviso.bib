  abstract = {Although there is a large body of theory on spatial competitive coexistence,
	very little of it involves comparative analyses of alternative mechanisms.
	We thus have limited knowledge of the conditions under which multiple
	spatial mechanisms can operate or of emergent properties arising
	from interactions between mechanisms. Here we present a mathematical
	framework that allows for comparative analysis of spatial coexistence
	mechanisms. The basis for comparison is mechanisms operating in spatially
	homogeneous competitive environments (e.g., life-history trade-offs)
	versus mechanisms operating in spatially heterogeneous competitive
	environments (e.g., source-sink dynamics). Our comparative approach
	leads to several new insights about spatial coexistence. First, we
	show that spatial variation in the expression of a life-history trade-off
	leads to a unique regional pattern that cannot be predicted by considering
	trade-offs or source-sink dynamics alone. This result represents
	an instance where spatial heterogeneity constrains rather than promotes
	coexistence, and it illustrates the kind of counterintuitive emergent
	properties that arise due to interactions between different classes
	of mechanisms. Second, we clarify the role of dispersal mortality
	in spatial coexistence. Previous studies have shown that coexistence
	can be constrained or facilitated by dispersal mortality. Our broader
	analysis distinguishes situations where dispersal mortality is not
	necessary for coexistence from those where such mortality is essential
	for coexistence because it preserves spatial variation in the strength
	of competition. These results form the basis for two important future
	directions: evolution of life-history traits in spatially heterogeneous
	environments and elucidation of the cause and effect relationship(s)
	between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.},

  abstract = {It is well known that dispersal from localities favourable to a species'
	growth and reproduction (sources) can prevent competitive exclusion
	in unfavourable localities (sinks). What is perhaps less well known
	is that too much emigration can undermine the viability of sources
	and cause regional competitive exclusion. Here, I investigate two
	biological mechanisms that reduce the cost of dispersal to source
	communities. The first involves increasing the spatial variation
	in the strength of competition such that sources can withstand high
	rates of emigration; the second involves reducing emigration from
	sources via density-dependent dispersal. I compare how different
	forms of spatial variation and modes of dispersal influence source
	viability, and hence source-sink coexistence, under dominance and
	pre-emptive competition. A key finding is that, while spatial variation
	substantially reduces dispersal costs under both types of competition,
	density-dependent dispersal does so only under dominance competition.
	For instance, when spatial variation in the strength of competition
	is high, coexistence is possible (regardless of the type of competition)
	even when sources experience high emigration rates; when spatial
	variation is low, coexistence is restricted even under low emigration
	rates. Under dominance competition, density-dependent dispersal has
	a strong effect on coexistence. For instance, when the emigration
	rate increases with density at an accelerating rate (Type III density-dependent
	dispersal), coexistence is possible even when spatial variation is
	quite low; when the emigration rate increases with density at a decelerating
	rate (Type II density-dependent dispersal), coexistence is restricted
	even when spatial variation is quite high. Under pre-emptive competition,
	density-dependent dispersal has only a marginal effect on coexistence.
	Thus, the diversity-reducing effects of high dispersal rates persist
	under pre-emptive competition even when dispersal is density dependent,
	but can be significantly mitigated under dominance competition if
	density-dependent dispersal is Type III rather than Type II. These
	results lead to testable predictions about source-sink coexistence
	under different regimes of competition, spatial variation and dispersal.
	They identify situations in which density-independent dispersal provides
	a reasonable approximation to species' dispersal patterns, and those
	under which consideration of density-dependent dispersal is crucial
	to predicting long-term coexistence.},

  month = {Jan},
  abstract = {I investigate two aspects of source-sink theory that have hitherto
	received little attention: density-dependent dispersal and the cost
	of dispersal to sources. The cost arises because emigration reduces
	the per capita growth rate of sources, thus predisposing them to
	extinction. I show that source-sink persistence depends critically
	on the interplay between these two factors. When the emigration rate
	increases with abundance at an accelerating rate, dispersal costs
	to sources is the lowest and risk of source-sink extinction the least.
	When the emigration rate increases with abundance at a decelerating
	rate, dispersal costs to sources is the highest and the risk of source-sink
	extinction the greatest. Density-independent emigration has an intermediate
	effect. Thus, density-dependent dispersal per se does not increase
	or decrease source-sink persistence relative to density-independent
	dispersal. The exact mode of dispersal is crucial. A key point to
	appreciate is that these effects of dispersal on source-sink extinction
	arise from the temporal density-dependence that dispersal induces
	in the per capita growth rates of source and sink populations. Temporal
	density-dependence due to dispersal is beneficial at low abundances
	because it rescues sinks from extinction, and detrimental at high
	abundances because it drives otherwise viable sources to extinction.
	These results are robust to the nature of population dynamics in
	the sink, whether exponential or logistic. They provide a means of
	assessing the relative costs and benefits of preserving sink habitats
	given three biological parameters.},

  abstract = {1. I investigated the effects of dispersal on communities of keystone
	predators and prey. I obtained two key results. 2. First, a strong
	trade-off between competitive ability and predator susceptibility
	allows consumer coexistence over a large resource productivity range,
	but it also lowers the predator-susceptible superior competitor's
	abundance and increases its risk of extinction. Thus, unexpectedly,
	dispersal plays a more important role in coexistence when predator-mediated
	coexistence is strong rather than weak. The interplay between the
	trade-off, small population sizes resulting from transient oscillations,
	and dispersal leads to qualitatively different species distributions
	depending on the relative mobilities of the consumers and predator.
	These differences yield comparative predictions that can be tested
	with data on trade-off strength, dispersal rates, and species distributions
	across productivity gradients. 3. Second, there is an asymmetry between
	species in their dispersal effects: the predator-resistant inferior
	competitor's dispersal has a large effect, but the predator-susceptible
	superior competitor's dispersal has no effect, on coexistence and
	species' distributions. The inferior competitor's dispersal also
	mediates the predator's dispersal effects: the predator's dispersal
	has no effect when the inferior competitor is immobile, and a large
	effect when it is mobile. The net outcome of the direct and indirect
	effects of the inferior competitor's dispersal is a qualitative change
	in the species' distributions from interspecific segregation to interspecific
	aggregation. 4. The important point is that differences between species
	in how they balance resource acquisition and predator avoidance can
	lead to unexpected differences in their dispersal effects. While
	consumer coexistence in the absence of dispersal is driven largely
	by the top predator, consumer coexistence in the presence of dispersal
	is driven largely by the predator-resistant inferior competitor.},

	such species are often specialized antagonists of one or both mutualists.
	Hence, these models can also shed light on the problem of when and
	how mutualisms are able to persist in the face of exploitation. We
	used spatial stochastic simulations to model the ecological dynamics
	of obligate, species-specific mutualisms between plants and pollinating
	seed parasite insects (e.g., yuccas and yucca moths) in the presence
	of one of two obligate antagonist species: flower-feeding insects
	(florivores) or insects that parasitize seeds but fail to pollinate
	(exploiters). Our results suggest that mutualisms can persist surprisingly
	well in the presence of highly specialized antagonists but that they
	exhibit distinctly different temporal and spatial dynamics when antagonists
	are present. In our models, antagonists tend to induce oscillations
	in the mutualist populations. As the number of per capita visits
	by antagonists increase, the system's oscillatory dynamics become
	more extreme, finally leading to the extinction of one or more of
	the three species. When the antagonists exhibit high per capita visitation
	frequencies and long dispersal distances, significant spatial patchiness
	emerges within these tripartite interactions. We found surprisingly
	little difference between the ecological effects of florivores and
	exploiters, although in general florivores tended to drive themselves
	(and sometimes the mutualists) to extinction at parameter values
	at which the exploiters were able to persist. These theoretical results
	suggest several testable hypotheses regarding the ecological and
	evolutionary persistence of mutualisms. More broadly, they point

	and plants are involved in diverse forms of mutualism. Here we review
	evolutionary features of three prominent insect-plant mutualisms:
	pollination, protection and seed dispersal. We focus on addressing
	five central phenomena: evolutionary origins and maintenance of mutualism;
	the evolution of mutualistic traits; the evolution of specialization
	and generalization; coevolutionary processes; and the existence of
	cheating. Several features uniting very diverse insect-plant mutualisms
	are identified and their evolutionary implications are discussed:
	the involvement of one mobile and one sedentary partner; natural
	selection on plant rewards; the existence of a continuum from specialization
	to generalization; and the ubiquity of cheating, particularly on
	the part of insects. Plant-insect mutualisms have apparently both
	arisen and been lost repeatedly. Many adaptive hypotheses have been
	proposed to explain these transitions, and it is unlikely that any
	one of them dominates across interactions differing so widely in
	natural history. Evolutionary theory has a potentially important,
	but as yet largely unfilled, role to play in explaining the origins,
	maintenance, breakdown and evolution of insect-plant mutualisms.},

  abstract = {Recent theory suggests that absolute population size may qualitatively
	influence the outcome of evolution under disruptive selection in
	asexual populations. Large populations are predicted to undergo rapid
	evolutionary branching; however, in small populations, the waiting
	time to branching increases steeply with decreasing abundance, and
	below a critical size, the population remains monomorphic indefinitely.
	Here, we (1) extend the theory to sexual populations and (2) confront
	its predictions with empirical data, testing statistically whether
	lake size affects the level of resource polymorphism in arctic char
	(Salvelinus alpinus) in 22 lakes of different sizes. For a given
	level of recombination, our model predicts qualitatively similar
	relations between population size and time to evolutionary branching
	(either speciation or evolution of genetic polymorphism) as the asexual
	model, while recombination further increases the delay to branching.
	The loss of polymorphism at certain loci, an inherent aspect of multilocus‐trait
	evolution, may increase the delay to speciation, resulting in stable
	genetic polymorphism without speciation. The empirical analysis demonstrates
	that the occurrence of resource polymorphism depends on both lake
	size and the number of coexisting fish species. For a given number
	of coexisting species, the level of polymorphism increases significantly
	with lake size, thus confirming our model prediction.},

  abstract = {The neutral theory of biodiversity as put forward by Hubbell in his
	2001 monograph has received much criticism for its unrealistic simplifying
	assumptions. These are the assumptions of functional equivalence
	among different species (neutrality), the assumption of point mutation
	speciation, and the assumption that resources are continuously saturated,
	such that constant resource availability implies constant community
	size (zero-sum assumption). Here we focus on the zero-sum assumption.
	We present a general theory for calculating the probability of observing
	a particular species-abundance distribution (sampling formula) and
	show that zero-sum and non-zero-sum formulations of neutral theory
	have exactly the same sampling formula when the community is in equilibrium.
	Moreover, for the non-zero-sum community the sampling formula has
	this same form, even out of equilibrium. Therefore, the term "zero-sum
	multinomial (ZSM)" to describe species abundance patterns, as coined
	by Hubbell [2001. The Unified Neutral Theory of Biodiversity and
	Biogeography, Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ], is not
	really appropriate, as it also applies to non-zero-sum communities.
	Instead we propose the term "dispersal-limited multinomial (DLM)",
	thus making explicit one of the most important contributions of neutral
	community theory, the emphasis on dispersal limitation as a dominant
	factor in determining species abundances.},

  abstract = {We study the spatial adaptive dynamics of a continuous trait that
	measures individual investment in altruism. Our study is based on
	an ecological model of a spatially heterogeneous population from
	which we derive an appropriate measure of fitness. The analysis of
	this fitness measure uncovers three different selective processes
	controlling the evolution of altruism: the direct physiological cost,
	the indirect genetic benefits of cooperative interactions, and the
	indirect genetic costs of competition for space. In our model, habitat
	structure and a continuous life cycle makes the cost of competing
	for space with relatives negligible. Our study yields a classification
	of adaptive patterns of altruism according to the shape of the costs
	of altruism (with decelerating, linear, or accelerating dependence
	on the investment in altruism). The invasion of altruism occurs readily
	in species with accelerating costs, but large mutations are critical
	for altruism to evolve in selfish species with decelerating costs.
	Strict selfishness is maintained by natural selection only under
	very restricted conditions. In species with rapidly accelerating
	costs, adaptation leads to an evolutionarily stable rate of investment
	in altruism that decreases smoothly with the level of mobility. A
	rather different adaptive pattern emerges in species with slowly
	accelerating costs: high altruism evolves at low mobility, whereas
	a quasi-selfish state is promoted in more mobile species. The high
	adaptive level of altruism can be predicted solely from habitat connectedness
	and physiological parameters that characterize the pattern of cost.
	We also show that environmental changes that cause increased mobility
	in those highly altruistic species can beget selection-driven self-extinction,
	which may contribute to the rarity of social species.},

	First, hot spots need not be ubiquitous to have a global influence
	on evolution, although rare hat spots wilt not have a disproportionate
	impact unless selection is relatively strong there. Second, asymmetries
	in gene flow can influence local adaptation, sometimes creating stable
	equilibria at which species experience minimal fitness in hot spots
	and maximal fitness in cold spots, or vice versa. Third, asymmetries
	in gene flow are no more important than asymmetries in population
	regulation for determining the maintenance of local polymorphisms
	through coevolution. Fourth, intraspecific allele frequency differences
	among hot and cold spot populations evolve under some, but not all,
	conditions. That is, selection mosaics are indeed capable of producing
	spatially variable coevolutionary outcomes across the landscapes
	over which species interact. Altogether, our analyses indicate that

  abstract = {Many mutualistic interactions are probably not mutualistic across
	all populations and years. This article explores consequences of
	this observation with a series of genetic models that consider how
	variable mutualisms coevolve. The first models, previously introduced
	in a general coevolutionary context, consider two coevolving species
	whose fitness interactions change between beneficial and antagonistic
	in response to independent spatial or temporal variation in the abiotic
	or biotic environment. The results demonstrate that both temporal
	and spatial variability in fitness interactions can cause partner
	species with tightly matched traits favored by unconditional mutualisms
	to be vulnerable to evolutionary invasion by alternative types. A
	new model presented here shows that an additional mutualistic species
	can have a similar effect and can even cause fitness interactions
	between the other two species to evolve. Under some conditions, the
	pairwise interactions can change unidirectionally from mutualistic
	to antagonistic, with virtually no evolutionary change in either

	shaping biodiversity [1-10]. Among them, interaction intimacy, the
	degree of biological association between partners, leads to differences
	in specialization patterns [4, 11] and might affect network organization
	[12]. Here, we investigated potential consequences of interaction
	intimacy for the structure and coevolution of mutualistic networks.
	From observed processes of selection on mutualistic interactions,
	it is expected that symbiotic interactions (high-interaction intimacy)
	will form species-poor networks characterized by compartmentalization
	[12, 13], whereas nonsymbiotic interactions (low intimacy) will lead
	to species-rich, nested networks in which there is a core of generalists
	and specialists often interact with generalists [3, 5, 7, 12, 14].
	We demonstrated an association between interaction intimacy and structure
	in 19 ant-plant mutualistic networks. Through numerical simulations,
	we found that network structure of different forms of mutualism affects
	evolutionary change in distinct ways. Change in one species affects
	primarily one mutualistic partner in symbiotic interactions but might
	affect multiple partners in nonsymbiotic interactions. We hypothesize
	that coevolution in symbiotic interactions is characterized by frequent
	reciprocal changes between few partners, but coevolution in nonsymbiotic
	networks might show rare bursts of changes in which many species
	respond to evolutionary changes in a single species.},

  abstract = {Since the publication of the unified neutral theory in 2001, there
	has been much discussion of the theory, pro and con. The hypothesis
	of ecological equivalence is the fundamental yet controversial idea
	behind neutral theory. Assuming trophically similar species are demographically
	alike (symmetric) on a per capita basis is only an approximation,
	but it is equivalent to asking: How many of the patterns of ecological
	communities are the result of species similarities, rather than of
	species differences? The strategy behind neutral theory is to see
	how far one can get with the simplification of assuming ecological
	equivalence before introducing more complexity. In another paper,
	I review the empirical evidence that led me to hypothesize ecological
	equivalence among many of the tree species in the species-rich tropical
	forest on Barro Colorado Island (BCI). In this paper, I develop a
	simple model for the evolution of ecological equivalence or niche
	convergence, using as an example evolution of the suite of life history
	traits characteristic of shade tolerant tropical tree species. Although
	the model is simple, the conclusions from it seem likely to be robust.
	I conclude that ecological equivalence for resource use are likely
	to evolve easily and often, especially in species-rich communities
	that are dispersal and recruitment limited. In the case of the BCI
	forest, tree species are strongly dispersal- and recruitment-limited,
	not only because of restricted seed dispersal, but also because of
	low recruitment success due to heavy losses of the seedling stages
	to predators and pathogens and other abiotic stresses such as drought.
	These factors and the high species richness of the community strongly
	reduce the potential for competitive exclusion of functionally equivalent
	or nearly equivalent species.},

	Lower-level processes, in particular adaptation (whether by behavioral,

	Here, we show that complex, realistic food webs may emerge by evolution
	from a single ancestor based on very simple ecological and evolutionary
	rules. In our model, adaptation acts on body size, whose impact on
	the metabolism and interactions of organisms is well established.
	Based on parameters defined at the organism scale, the model predicts
	emergent properties at the food-web scale. Variations of two key
	parameters (width of consumption niche and competition intensity)
	allow very different food-web structures and functionings to emerge,

	of two sets of entities, plant and animal species, whose evolutionary
	dynamics are deeply influenced by the outcomes of the interactions,
	yielding a diverse array of coevolutionary processes. These networks
	are two-mode networks sharing many common properties with others
	such as food webs, social, and abiotic networks. Here we describe
	generalized patterns in the topology of 29 plant-pollinator and 24
	plant-frugivore networks in natural communities. Scale-free properties
	have been described for a number of biological, social, and abiotic
	networks; in contrast, most of the plant-animal mutualistic networks
	(65.6%) show species connectivity distributions (number of links
	per species) with a power-law regime but decaying as a marked cut-off,
	i.e. truncated power-law or broad-scale networks and few (22.2%)
	show scale-invariance. We hypothesize that plant-animal mutualistic
	networks follow a build-up process similar to complex abiotic nets,
	based on the preferential attachment of species. However, constraints
	in the addition of links such as morphological mismatching or phenological
	uncoupling between mutualistic partners, restrict the number of interactions
	established, causing deviations from scale-invariance. This reveals
	generalized topological patterns characteristic of self-organized
	complex systems. Relative to scale-invariant networks, such constraints
	may confer higher robustness to the loss of keystone species that

	links remain unobservable, irrespective of sampling effort. They

	for example, we recorded flower-visit links for one full season,
	arranged data in an interaction matrix and got a connectance C of
	15 per cent. Interaction accumulation curves documented our sampling
	of interactions through observation of visits to be robust. Then,
	we included data on pollen from the body surface of flower visitors

	missing from the visitation data. Thus, the combined visit-pollen
	matrix got an increased C of 20 per cent. For the three networks,
	C ranged from 20 to 52 per cent, and thus the percentage of unobserved
	links (100 - C) was 48 to 80 per cent; these were assumed forbidden

	Phenological uncoupling (i.e. non-overlapping phenophases between

	22 to 28 per cent of all possible, but unobserved links. Increasing

  abstract = {Birds show striking interspecific variation in their use of carotenoid-based
	coloration. Theory predicts that the use of carotenoids for coloration
	is closely associated with the availability of carotenoids in the
	diet but, although this prediction has been supported in single-species
	studies and those using small numbers of closely related species,
	there have been no broad-scale quantitative tests of the link between
	carotenoid coloration and diet. Here we test for such a link using
	modern comparative methods, a database on 140 families of birds and
	two alternative avian phylogenies. We show that carotenoid pigmentation
	is more common in the bare parts (legs, bill and skin) than in plumage,
	and that yellow coloration is more common than red. We also show
	that there is no simple, general association between the availability
	of carotenoids in the diet and the overall use of carotenoid-based
	coloration. However, when we look at plumage coloration separately
	from bare part coloration, we find there is a robust and significant
	association between diet and plumage coloration, but not between
	diet and bare part coloration. Similarly, when we look at yellow
	and red plumage colours separately, we find that the association
	between diet and coloration is typically stronger for red coloration
	than it is for yellow coloration. Finally, when we build multivariate
	models to explain variation in each type of carotenoid-based coloration
	we find that a variety of life history and ecological factors are
	associated with different aspects of coloration, with dietary carotenoids
	only being a consistent significant factor in the case of variation
	in plumage. All of these results remain qualitatively unchanged irrespective
	of the phylogeny used in the analyses, although in some cases the
	precise life history and ecological variables included in the multivariate
	models do vary. Taken together, these results indicate that the predicted
	link between carotenoid coloration and diet is idiosyncratic rather
	than general, being strongest with respect to plumage colours and
	weakest for bare part coloration. We therefore suggest that, although
	the carotenoid-based bird plumage may a good model for diet-mediated
	signalling, the use of carotenoids in bare part pigmentation may
	have a very different functional basis and may be more strongly influenced
	by genetic and physiological mechanisms, which currently remain relatively
	understudied.},

	and very few analyze their temporal dynamics. Yet, understanding
	network dynamics is important in order to relate network patterns
	to ecological processes. We studied the day-to-day dynamics of an
	arctic pollination interaction network over two consecutive seasons.
	First, we found that new species entering the network tend to interact
	with already well-connected species, although there are deviations
	from this trend due, for example, to morphological mismatching between
	plant and pollinator traits and nonoverlapping phenophases of plant
	and pollinator species. Thus, temporal dynamics provides a mechanistic
	explanation for previously reported network patterns such as the
	heterogeneous distribution of number of interactions across species.
	Second, we looked for the ecological properties most likely to be
	mediating this dynamical process and found that both abundance and
	phenophase length were important determinants of the number of links
	per species.},

	explain the pervasive tendency of specialists to interact with proper
	subsets of species that generalists interact with (nested interactions),
	and how phylogeny affects such interaction patterns. Simultaneously,
	we assessed whether complementarity and phylogenctic structure were
	associated with patterns of interaction in a real mutualistic community.
	Simulation results support that highly nested networks can emerge
	from phenotypic complementarity, particularly when several traits
	are involved. The hierarchical structure of phylogenetic relations
	can also contribute to increased nestedness because traits determining
	complementaricy are then inherited in a correlated fashion. Phylogenetic
	effects on resulting generalization levels are often low, but can
	be detected. Results from the empirical network support a relevant
	role of complementarity and phylogenetic history on interaction patterns.
	Our results demonstrate that these factors can contribute to nestedness,

	The need to understand coevolution as an ongoing process has grown

	is to understand how coevolution operates across broad geographic

	framework for asking how coevolution continually reshapes interactions

	coevolution at the local scale. It also provides a framework for
	understanding how local maladaptation can result from coevolution
	and why coevolved interactions may rarely produce long lists of coevolved
	traits that become fixed within species. Long-term field studies
	of the same interaction across multiple communities and spatially

  abstract = {1. Few theoretical studies have examined the impact of immigration
	and emigration on mutualist population dynamics, but a recent empirical
	study (A.R. Thompson Oecologia, 143, 61-69) on mutualistic fish and
	shrimp showed that immigration can prevent population collapse, and
	that intraspecific competition for a mutualistic partner can curb
	population expansion. To understand in a theoretical context the
	implications of these results, and to assess their generality, we
	present a two-species model that accounts explicitly for immigration
	and emigration, as well as distinguishing the impacts of mutualism
	on birth rates, death rates and habitat acquisition. 2. The model
	confirms that immigration can stabilize mutualistic populations,
	and predicts that high immigration, along with enhanced reproduction
	and/or reduced mortality through mutualism, can cause population
	sizes to increase until habitat availability curbs further expansion.
	3. We explore in detail the effects of different forms of habitat
	limitation on mutualistic populations. Habitat availability commonly
	limits the density of both populations if mutualists acquire shelter
	independently. If a mutualist depends on a partner for habitat, densities
	of that mutualist are capped by the amount of space provided by that
	partner. The density of the shelter-provider is limited by the environment.
	4. If a mutualism solely augments reproduction, and most locally
	produced individuals leave the focal patch, then the mutualism will
	have a minimal effect on local dynamics. If the mutualism operates
	by reducing rates of death or enhancing habitat availability, and
	there is at least some immigration, then mutualism will affect local
	dynamics. This finding may be particularly relevant in marine systems,
	where there is high variability (among species and locations) in
	the extent to which progeny disperse from natal locations. 5. Overall,
	our results demonstrate that the consequences of immigration and
	emigration for the dynamics of mutualists depend strongly on which
	demographic rate is influenced by mutualism. 6. By relating our model
	to a variety of terrestrial and aquatic systems, we provide a general
	framework to guide future empirical studies of the dynamics of mutualistic
	populations.},

  abstract = {Background Ecologists and evolutionary biologists are becoming increasingly
	interested in networks as a framework to study plant-animal mutualisms
	within their ecological context. Although such focus on networks
	has brought about important insights into the structure of these
	interactions, relatively little is still known about the mechanisms
	behind these patterns. Scope The aim in this paper is to offer an
	overview of the mechanisms influencing the structure of plant-animal
	mutualistic networks. A brief summary is presented of the salient
	network patterns, the potential mechanisms are discussed and the
	studies that have evaluated them are reviewed. This review shows
	that researchers of plant-animal mutualisms have made substantial
	progress in the understanding of the processes behind the patterns
	observed in mutualistic networks. At the same time, we are still
	far from a thorough, integrative mechanistic understanding. We close
	with specific suggestions for directions of future research, which
	include developing methods to evaluate the relative importance of
	mechanisms influencing network patterns and focusing research efforts
	on selected representative study systems throughout the world.},

	recent empirical work has revealed that ecological networks are highly
	structured, and the lack of a theory that takes into account the
	structure of interactions precludes further assessment of the implications
	of such network patterns for biodiversity. Here we use a combination
	of analytical and empirical approaches to quantify the influence
	of network architecture on the number of coexisting species. As a
	case study we consider mutualistic networks between plants and their
	animal pollinators or seed dispersers. These networks have been found
	to be highly nested, with the more specialist species interacting
	only with proper subsets of the species that interact with the more
	generalist. We show that nestedness reduces effective interspecific
	competition and enhances the number of coexisting species. Furthermore,
	we show that a nested network will naturally emerge if new species
	are more likely to enter the community where they have minimal competitive
	load. Nested networks seem to occur in many biological and social
	contexts, suggesting that our results are relevant in a wide range
	of fields.},

  abstract = {Most empirical studies support a decline in speciation rates through
	time, although evidence for constant speciation rates also exists.
	Declining rates have been explained by invoking pre-existing niches,
	whereas constant rates have been attributed to non-adaptive processes
	such as sexual selection and mutation. Trends in speciation rate
	and the processes underlying it remain unclear, representing a critical
	information gap in understanding patterns of global diversity. Here
	we show that the temporal trend in the speciation rate can also be
	explained by frequency-dependent selection. We construct a frequency-dependent
	and DNA sequence-based model of speciation. We compare our model
	to empirical diversity patterns observed for cichlid fish and Darwin's
	finches, two classic systems for which speciation rates and richness
	data exist. Negative frequency-dependent selection predicts well
	both the declining speciation rate found in cichlid fish and explains
	their species richness. For groups like the Darwin's finches, in
	which speciation rates are constant and diversity is lower, speciation
	rate is better explained by a model without frequency-dependent selection.
	Our analysis shows that differences in diversity may be driven by
	incipient species abundance with frequency-dependent selection. Our
	results demonstrate that genetic-distance-based speciation and frequency-dependent
	selection are sufficient to explain the high diversity observed in
	natural systems and, importantly, predict decay through time in speciation
	rate in the absence of pre-existing niches.},

  journal = {Ecology},
  year = {1996},

  abstract = {One view of pollination systems is that they tend toward specialization.
	This view is implicit in many discussions of angiosperm evolution
	and plant—pollinator coevolution and in the long—standing concept
	of pollination syndromes. But actual pollination systems often are
	more generalized and dynamic than these traditions might suggest.
	To illustrate the range of specialization and generalization in pollinators'
	use of plants and vice versa, we draw on studies of two floras in
	the United States, and of members of several plant families and solitary
	bee genera. We also summarize a recent study of one local flora which
	suggests that, although the colors of flowers are aggregated in phenotype
	space, there is no strong association with pollinator types as pollination
	syndromes would predict. That moderate to substantial generalization
	often occurs is not surprising on theoretical grounds. Plant generalization
	is predicted by a simple model as long as temporal and spatial variance
	in pollinator quality is appreciable, different pollinator species
	do not fluctuate in unison, and they are similar in their pollination
	effectiveness. Pollinator generalization is predicted when floral
	rewards are similar across plant species, travel is costly, constraints
	of behavior and morphology are minor, and/or pollinator lifespan
	is long relative to flowering of individual plant species. Recognizing
	that pollination systems often are generalized has important implications.
	In ecological predictions of plant reproductive success and population
	dynamics it is useful to widen the focus beyond flower visitors within
	the correct" pollination syndrome, and to recognize temporal and
	spatial fluidity of interactions. Behavioral studies of pollinator
	foraging choices and information—processing abilities will benefit
	from understanding the selective advantages of generalization. In
	studies of floral adaptation, microevolution, and plant speciation
	one should recognize that selection and gene flow vary in time and
	space and that the contribution of pollinators to reproductive isolation
	of plant species may be overstated. In conservation biology, generalized
	pollination systems imply resilience to linked extinctions, but also
	the possibility for introduced generalists to displace natives with
	a net loss of diversity.
