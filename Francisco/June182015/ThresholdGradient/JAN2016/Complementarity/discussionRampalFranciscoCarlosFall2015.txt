You are simply counting the number of convergences, right?

If they deviate from normality, we should count convergence comparing the distributions both from the model and data, but as far as I know it is difficult to have the distributions from the empirical data.
what distributions?

You lost me again :-(

There are several two loci models of speciation with one locus determining mating and the other resource use and they can be highly linked or be independent. We are not using empirical phylogenies to calculate convergence but just removing all the species within the same genera (assuming they are the sister species, but I have checked the empirical data and some species within the same genera differ strongly in the mean phenotipic value).
Classical taxonomy may indeed be wrong. I guess we could make the point that theory is ahead of the data, because we often don't have the phylogenies. For frugivorous bird networks there should be a decent phylogeny for the birds at least.
Have you tried a quick phylogeny using phylogenerator? You just enter the species names, and it will look up the sequences in GenBank etc, and build a maximum likelihood tree (if there is data of course). We only need to know topology, not branch lengths, so this may work.

Now, I don't know this. Is this similar to Google Docs? And is it WYSIWYG, like in Lyx? And can you use track changes?

I have a programmer who works for me now and then (I share him with some colleagues). He is really good! I can ask him to make a C++ implementation of the program.

Hi Carlos, Fran,

The way I understand it is this:

1. Take a focal species. Let's call this species A.
2. Identify its sister species. Let's call them B.
3. Identify all the other species. Let's call them C.
4. Take one species from C, call it C_i
5. Now, C_i is convergent with A if the phenotypic similarity between C_i and A is larger than between B and A.
6. Do this for all i and for all A and count how many convergence events we have.

Note that I did not impose the threshold because I think line 5 is really the right definition for convergence. The threshold is arbitrary. In your original plots we observed that the % convergence reached a plateau when decreasing the threshold. This is exactly what one would expect. But somehow you removed this, and I don't quite understand what you did to remove this.

I think there is one feature in the model that can explain discrepancies between observed and predicted curves:
In the model the same 150 loci are used to determine the quantitative trait AND the phylogenetic distance between species. Perhaps using such loci that are tightly bound to mating and therefore to speciation is the right way to build the phylogeny, but that is NOT the kind of data used to build the empirical phylogenies (you are using empirical phylogenies, are you not? How do you otherwise take out the sister species?)

Cheers,

Rampal

By then, I will be close to 1 month holidays (after I have submitted my tenure) and I wont return until the first week of September.

As the ms stands, I don't think it is suitable for publication in Ecology Letters (I would reject it as editor), because of the remaining mismatch between theory and data, leaving it a mainly theoretical exercise. But if you can show that with this model we get a very good match (for example, by using a lower threshold - if justifiable, or by comparing similarity patterns themselves without needing a threshold), then this is a potential Ecology Letters ms. I do think that in the latter case both abstract and cover letter need a bit more work to have a chance in Ecology Letters. We then need to argue much more strongly that we succeed where previous models have failed (so we need to emphasize more their failure and more our success), but again only if we can justify this claim.

I wonder whether this threshold isn't a bit artificial. What threshold is used in empirical systems to define complementarity and convergence?
